This is an open-source project initiative by the Computational Cognitive Science group under Prof Benedikt Ehinger at the University of Stuttgart. The project aims to develop a data organization, standardization, and archiving workflow for EEG and Eye Tracking data collected in neuroscience experiments. The project is part of the larger initiative to improve data management practices in the field of cognitive science and neuroscience owing to the large corpus of data generated in such experiments making it both difficult and tedious to manage.

The project is written in Python and its main features include:
- **Data Standardization**: Converting raw data into BIDS complaint datasets 
- **Data Versioning**: Using Datalad to version control the datasets
- **Data Archiving**: Using Dataverse for archiving the datasets
