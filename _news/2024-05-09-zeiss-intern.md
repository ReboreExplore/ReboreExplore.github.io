Zoined Carl Zeiss AG as a Research Intern in Computer Vision and Software Engineering for a period of 6 months. There I contributed to working on a Proof of Concept prototype for hand-free microscopy control with different interaction modalities. Additionaly, I also worked on analyzing contextual understanding of Vision Language Models (VLMs) for microscopy contexts.
