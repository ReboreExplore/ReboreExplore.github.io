I joined the Computational Cognitive Science group supervised by Prof. Benedikt Ehinger at the University of Stuttgart as a research assistant. I have joined as an open source developer for the project "LSLAutoBIDS" which aims to develop a data orginzation, standardization and archiving workflow for the  EEG and Eye Tracking data collected in neuroscience experiments.
