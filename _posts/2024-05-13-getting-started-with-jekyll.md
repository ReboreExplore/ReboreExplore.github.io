Writing regularly is a great practise and being able to organize the work in a static website is like a cherry on the top.
Prior to this I have tried to jot down my ideas in a lot of blog sites like wordpress and medium but having one custom made 
according to my flavours is something that brought me to jekyll.

This static website is quite simple and easy to maintain for making minimal blogs to be hosted in Github.

Let's quickly make a start and midway we will discuss about some other random details.


**Step 1:** Go to the official website [here](https://jekyllrb.com/).

**Step 2:** Install all the requirements according to your operating system. Follow the Guide header and install the prerequisites 
[here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

**Step 3:** Create a new directory in your local machine for your site and name it whatever you want.

**Step 4:** Follow the [Step by Step tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) which is quite easy to follow from the official website.//
*Note: Step 3 will be repeated under the "Create a site" header in the tutorial page. You do not need to recreate the folder.* 
You should have your site setup up after all these steps.

A little bit of css should help you add a lot more customizations to your site later.

I will keep sharing about my progress regularly.
